                            The South Island robin occurs in forest and scrub habitats, where it spends much
                            time foraging on the ground, and can be recognised by its erect stance and
                            relatively long legs. It is a territorial species, males in particular
                            inhabiting the same patch of forest throughout their lives. Males are great
                            songsters, particularly bachelors, singing loudly and often for many minutes at
                            a time. Where robins are regularly exposed to people, such as along public
                            walking tracks, they become quite confiding, often approaching to within a metre
                            of a person sitting quietly. Juveniles will sometimes stand on a person’s boot.

                            The South Island robin, also known as kakaruwai, is known for its friendly and
                            curious nature, often approaching humans and even hopping onto their boots while
                            foraging for food.

                                suburbia – unless you live in Canterbury. They look black from a distance, but
                                in good light tūī have a blue, green and bronze iridescent sheen, and
                                distinctive white throat tufts (poi). They are usually very vocal, with a
                                complicated mix of tuneful notes interspersed with coughs, grunts and wheezes.
                                In flight, their bodies slant with the head higher than the tail, and their
                                noisy whirring flight is interspersed with short glides.

                                Tanemahuta, the father of the forest noticed that his children, the trees were
                                sickening, as they were being eaten by bugs. He spoke to his brother
                                Tanehokahoka who called to his children, the birds, to come together. Tanemahuta
                                told the birds that his children were dying and that he needed one of them to
                                come from the forest roof to live on the forest floor. Tūī shuddered when he
                                looked down and saw the cold, dark forest floor. Tūī preferred the forest roof
                                and the filtering sun through the leaves. He was afraid of the dark. Tūī said no
                                to Tanemahuta. Kiwi was the brave bird that said yes. Tūī are very recognizable
                                with their distinctive white tuft under their throat.

                                    Tuatara can be identified by their unique features, including a spiny crest
                                    along their back, a lack of external ears, and a distinctive arrangement of
                                    teeth with two rows on the upper jaw. They are typically greenish-brown in color
                                    and can grow up to 80 cm (31 inches) long.

                                    Mostly nocturnal, the tuatara - like lizards - will bask on rocks in the sun
                                    during the day. They are very slow growing, take 2 to 5 years for each
                                    reproduction cycle, and live for a very long time.

                                    Tuatara can live for over 100 years, making them one of the longest-living
                                    reptiles in the world. They are also unique because they have a "third eye" on
                                    the top of their head, which is sensitive to light but not used for seeing.

                                        The hihi (stitchbird) was both rare and poorly known until the 1990s, as few
                                        people had an opportunity to visit the single remnant population on Little
                                        Barrier Island. However, thanks to successful conservation management and
                                        research, the hihi is now one of the better studied New Zealand bird species,
                                        and can be seen at several accessible translocation sites. Hihi are often
                                        curious, approaching people for close examination whilst emitting warning calls;
                                        yet the calls’ high pitch, and the bird’s rapid movements and colouration can
                                        make them hard to detect.

                                        Hihi means ‘rays of the sun’. In reference to the bird, hihi refers to the
                                        male’s yellow breast plumage which looks like the colour of sun and fire. Māui
                                        the demigod, threw Hihi into the fire after Hihi had refused to bring water to
                                        Māui. Hihi’s feathers were burnt.

                                    The ruru (or morepork) is a small, dark, forest-dwelling owl. Found in both
                                    native and plantation forests, its distinctive “more-pork” call is commonly
                                    heard at night in many urban parks and well-vegetated suburbs. Ruru are
                                    relatively common throughout much of New Zealand but are sparse through the
                                    eastern and central South Island. Their diet consists of insects, small mammals
                                    and birds, which it hunts at night.

                                    The ruru (also called the morepork) is New Zealand’s only surviving native owl
                                    and it gets its name from the haunting “ruru… ruru…” sound of its call. In Māori
                                    tradition, the ruru is often seen as a kaitiaki (guardian) and a messenger
                                    between the living and the spirit world.
