                        Eight million hectares of New Zealand is covered with native forest.<br>The forest protects the soil from erosion. They cycle water between<br>the soil and atmosphere, produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide.<br>We need forests. But they are threatened by introduced pests such as<br>possums, goats, pigs, rats, mice and deer. Seedlings are trampled and<br>small trees, seeds and leaves get eaten.

                            for its dark green to bronze-green leaves and produces red to pinkish-red
                            berry-like cones that are an important food source for native birds.

                                diameter. The flowers which appear between August and December, are rich in

                                The berries are sweet and juicy and are a favourite of the kererū (wood pigeon).

                                    This fern is known to grow to heights of 10 metres or more. The crown is dense
                                    and mature fronds can be as much as 3 metres long and 1 m wide with a
                                    silver-white colouration on the undersides.

                                    The silver tree fern is a species of medium-sized tree fern, endemic (not found
                                    naturally anywhere else) to New Zealand. It arrived relatively late in New
                                    Zealand’s history during the Pliocene epoch (around 5 – 1.8 million years ago).
                                    The silver is found only on the undersides of mature ponga fronds. The
                                    silvery-white undersides catch the moonlight, creating a pathway of luminous
                                    arrows to guide travelers from darkness to safety.

                                    The silver fern is one of the most widely recognised symbols of New
                                    Zealand.[16][26] The first use of the silver fern as a symbol representing New
                                    Zealand was during the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team tour of Britain,
                                    after which the symbol came to be used on dairy products exported from New
                                    Zealand to the United Kingdom.

                                Kauri, or Agathis australis, is a large coniferous tree native to New Zealand,

                                over 2,000 years. These trees are significant in New Zealand's ecology and
                                history, providing unique habitats and were heavily logged for their valuable
                                timber and gum in the 19th and 20th centuries.
